various experiments with a language I don't know yet

Various experiments and examples in ATS2, a language that I don't
really know yet (but you may learn something by following along with
my trials and errors).

If you have ats2 installed in /usr/local, and you have the standard
build tools installed, you should be able to run each example via
`./qk dir/file.dats`
